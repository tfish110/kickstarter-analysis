# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

Our client, Louise, seeks funding to stage her play, *Fever*. She has launched a Kickstarter campaign and quickly generated most of her funding. She wants to know if the time of year that she started her campaign and the amount of money she has budgeted for the production will affect the likelihood that the campaign will achieve success.

### Purpose

This analysis aims to investigate data from various theater-based Kickstarter campaigns to discern whether the parameters of the campaigns have an impact on their success rates. The focus of this investigation is the impact of the campaign launch dates and the funding goals set by each campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

A table was created from the dataset which listed the total number of Kickstarter campaigns broken down by the month the campaign launched. The table was populated by using the pivot table function in Microsoft Excel to count the number of campaigns that fit the criteria for each cell in the table. The totals for each month were further divided into columns based on whether the campaign was successful, failed, or canceled. The campaigns were also filtered to include only theater-based campaigns. An option was included to also filter the results by a specific year.

The breakdown of the the outcomes for theater campaigns by the month they were launched for all years in the dataset (2009-2017) is displayed in this graph:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
